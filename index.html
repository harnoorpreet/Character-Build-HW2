        Sheldon Cooper - The Main Character
    </h3>
    <p class="lb_text">Sheldon Cooper is a highly distinctive and memorable character from the popular TV 
        series "The Big Bang Theory." Portrayed by actor Jim Parsons, Sheldon is a brilliant but
         socially awkward physicist with a penchant for strict routines, a keen interest in comic
          books, and an unparalleled mastery of various scientific fields. His character is known
           for his unparalleled intelligence, pedantic speech, and inability to grasp social norms
            and cues, which often leads to comedic situations. His complex personality, along with
             his memorable catchphrases and quirks, has made Sheldon one of the most iconic and beloved
              characters in the world of television, contributing significantly to the show's enduring
               popularity.</p>

                Leonard Hofstadter - The Second Main Character
            </h3>
            <p class="lb_text">Leonard Hofstadter, portrayed by actor Johnny Galecki, is a
                 central character in the hit TV series "The Big Bang Theory." Leonard is a
                  brilliant experimental physicist with a warm and endearing personality 
                  that contrasts sharply with his roommate Sheldon Cooper's quirks. His
                   down-to-earth nature and willingness to engage with the world outside of
                    his scientific pursuits provide a relatable and grounded perspective within
                     the group of friends.</p>
            <p class="lb_text"> Leonard's kind-hearted demeanor, along with his enduring and    
        at times tumultuous romantic relationship with Penny, adds depth to his character
         and serves as a significant driving force in the show's narrative. His blend of intelligence
          and relatability makes Leonard Hofstadter a beloved character among fans of the series. </p>
